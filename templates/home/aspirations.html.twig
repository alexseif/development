        <h2>Anxiety</h2>
        <p>
            Although I'm really over anxiety, however it's worthy to say now, that I don't believe anxiety and this pain
            I go through is a symptom of feeling lost or not knowing who I am. It's from forgetting one self, or better,
            forgetting to stay in touch with one's self
            (not necessarily anxiety)
